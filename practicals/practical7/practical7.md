## Overview

This practical is about creating a Shared Library in Jenkins that can be reused across multiple Node.js projects. The goal is to centralize commonly used pipeline steps like installing dependencies, running tests, building Docker images, and pushing to DockerHub.

Using a shared library promotes consistency, reduces duplication, and simplifies maintenance of Jenkins pipelines in larger projects or organizations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the practical, I ensured the following were installed and configured:

- Jenkins (locally or on a cloud instance)
- A GitHub repository for storing the shared library
- Docker installed and configured
- DockerHub account with access credentials
- Jenkins credentials for DockerHub (configured under Manage Jenkins → Credentials)
- Node.js projects using npm and Jest for testing

---

## Step 1: Created a Shared Library Repository

Created a new GitHub repository named `jenkins-shared-library`.

Added the required directory structure:

```bash
jenkins-shared-library/
├── vars/
│   └── nodePipeline.groovy
├── src/
│   └── org/example/Utilities.groovy
└── README.md
````

---

## Step 2: Wrote the Shared Library Script

Created a `nodePipeline.groovy` file inside the `vars/` directory with the following logic:

```groovy
def call(Map config = [:]) {
  pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
      nodejs 'NodeJS 24.0.2'
    }
    environment {
      DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('dockerhub-credentials')
    }
    stages {
      stage('Install') {
        steps {
          sh 'npm install'
        }
      }
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
          sh 'npm test -- --ci --reporters=jest-junit'
        }
        post {
          always {
            junit 'junit.xml'
          }
        }
      }
      stage('Build Docker Image') {
        steps {
          script {
            dockerImage = docker.build("${config.imageName}:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
          }
        }
      }
      stage('Push to DockerHub') {
        steps {
          script {
            docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'dockerhub-creds') {
              dockerImage.push()
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 3: Configured Jenkins to Use Shared Library

Went to **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.

Scrolled to **Global Pipeline Libraries**.

Added a new library with:

* **Name**: `shared-lib`
* **Default version**: `main`
* **Retrieval method**: Modern SCM → Git
* **Project Repository**: `https://github.com/Rabtens/jenkins-shared-library.git`

---

## Step 4: Created a Project Jenkinsfile

In the Node.js project repository, created a Jenkinsfile that uses the shared library:

```groovy
@Library('shared-lib') _
nodePipeline(imageName: 'rabtens/my-node-app')
```

This loads the shared library and executes the standardized pipeline logic using `nodePipeline()`.

---

## Step 5: Running the Pipeline

Triggered the pipeline by clicking **Build Now** in Jenkins. Jenkins fetched the shared library and ran all the defined stages.

---

## Challenge Completed: DockerHub Push

To complete the challenge, I implemented Docker image building and automatic pushing to DockerHub using Jenkins credentials and the Docker pipeline plugin.

* Created a DockerHub credential in Jenkins (`dockerhub-creds`).
* Used `docker.withRegistry` to authenticate and push images.
* Configured DockerHub repo visibility and tags using the Jenkins build number.

---

## Output and Screenshots

After running the pipeline, here’s what I observed:

* **Install**: npm dependencies installed successfully.
* **Test**: Jest ran tests and generated a `junit.xml` report.
* **Docker Build**: Image created with correct tags.
* **Docker Push**: Image successfully pushed to DockerHub.

## Key Learnings

* Learned how to structure and create a Jenkins Shared Library.
* Understood how to centralize reusable pipeline code for Node.js projects.
* Learned how to automate Docker image creation and push with Jenkins credentials.
* Gained experience in combining CI/CD best practices with Jenkins libraries.

## Conclusion

This practical focused on creating a reusable Jenkins shared library to streamline CI/CD steps across Node.js projects. The shared library approach reduces duplication, improves consistency, and simplifies the management of Jenkins pipelines.

Working through this practical helped reinforce the importance of modular design in DevOps pipelines and showed how shared libraries make Jenkins more scalable and maintainable.
